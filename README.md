# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
    -The Purpose of this project was to help Louise see the funding data for her play ~Fever~. With this data we were able to give Louise an extreme in depth look at here funding goals in comparison to other productions. We were able to show Louise how close she was to funding her project, the amount of backers and what percentage of the play was funded. Our purpose with this Data with Louise was to make it as effortles as possible and sorted to where she can easily navigate and get all the information she needs. We even presented Louise with charts to show here important data in the simplest form. 

## Analysis and Challenges
    -I ran into quite a few challenges being this is my first time with any of this at all. My main challenges were really making sure the formulas in excel were written correctly. Many times i would encounter the "Not enough Parameters" or even just not putting a comma or quoatation where i need to. Trying to remember when to put a comma, quotations, and parentheses can become difficult. This excercise was absolutely perfect to "kickstart" for sure. Through the days I feel more and more comfortable about the information and writing and memorizing the formulas.
    -As these screenshots show, we were able to see what the percentage of the goal was met. We showed a graph of the successes and failures by month, and even put the ability to filter that information by year. Using the code for percentage =Round(cell,cell *100,0) was how we were able to determine what percentage of the productions were funded.https://github.com/dlagorealestate/kickstarter/blob/main/96D7FC08-000A-46F2-8A74-A23FC75F4CA6.jpeg
