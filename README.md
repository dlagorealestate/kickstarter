# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
    -The Purpose of this project was to help Louise see the funding data for her play ~Fever~. With this data we were able to give Louise an extreme in depth look at here funding goals in comparison to other productions. We were able to show Louise how close she was to funding her project, the amount of backers and what percentage of the play was funded. Our purpose with this Data with Louise was to make it as effortles as possible and sorted to where she can easily navigate and get all the information she needs. We even presented Louise with charts to show here important data in the simplest form. 

## Analysis and Challenges
    -I ran into quite a few challenges being this is my first time with any of this at all. My main challenges were really making sure the formulas in excel were written correctly. Many times i would encounter the "Not enough Parameters" or even just not putting a comma or quoatation where i need to. Trying to remember when to put a comma, quotations, and parentheses can become difficult. This excercise was absolutely perfect to "kickstart" for sure. Through the days I feel more and more comfortable about the information and writing and memorizing the formulas.
    -As these screenshots show, we were able to see what the percentage of the goal was met. We showed a graph of the successes and failures by month, and even put the ability to filter that information by year. Using the code for percentage =Round(cell,cell *100,0) was how we were able to determine what percentage of the productions were funded. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    -Based on our analysis, we were able to show the outcomes based off the years they launched. We are able to see month to month what months were the best months for the theater productions. We filtered the data by year, success, failure and canceled. With this data we can easily navigate through and compare the plays to see what the prime release date can be for future projects. We created a graph to simplify the data and easily show the overall range from 2009-2017 how the theater projects do throughtout every year. The goal is to see what is consistent to be able to help future projects succeed.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    -With the analysis of the outcomes based on the goal amount, we wanted to see what percent of those goals were met. We wanted to figure out how many were succesful and failed with in a specific goal amount. We took the data and divided it by the toal number of the projects with the same goal amount to see what percentage of it was met. We created a line graph to easily present the data in a simplified format.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   +One conclusion that we can draw about the data is that definitely during the beginning of the summer months we saw a dramatic increase with the successful theater projects typically due to summer time and people spendning more time off work and with families to do these types of activities. We immediately see a huge drop off in the fall, typically when school starts and of course through the holidays when most people are more conservative with spending.
  
   +The second conclusion we can make is to definitely release a play during the summer months. May, June, July, were the most successful based on the data we took. Releasing a play during these month you are sure to have the most success in comparison to any other time of year. When we filter random years in and out the one consistency we see is the peaks in the beginning and thorugh the summer months. 
  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
   +Being that im very new to this, this data set looks to provied all the necessary information to inform Louise on not only her play but the comparison to other plays so that she can have a better idea of when to release her play and how long the funding typically can take.
   
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
